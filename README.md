# FeedForwardAndBackProp
Machine Learning 6

The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience developing one of the main algorithms for
training feedforward neural networks—backpropagation. In this project, you will compare a feedforward
network trained with backprop to your previous implementation of the radial basis function network. You
will also use the same five datasets that you used from Project 1 and Project 4 from the UCI Machine
Learning Repository, namely:

1. Breast Cancer — https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29
This breast cancer databases was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from
Dr. William H. Wolberg.

2. Glass — https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Glass+Identification
The study of classification of types of glass was motivated by criminological investigation.

3. Iris — https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris
The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.

4. Soybean (small) — https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Soybean+%28Small%29
A small subset of the original soybean database.

5. Vote — https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Congressional+Voting+Records
This data set includes votes for each of the U.S. House of Representatives Congressmen on the 16 key
votes identified by the Congressional Quarterly Almanac.
